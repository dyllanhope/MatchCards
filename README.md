# Match! Card Game

The "Match!" card game is a simple two-player game where cards are drawn from a shuffled deck, and players compete to find matching pairs based on a specified condition (suits, values, or both). The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.

## Rules

1. **Game Setup:**
   - Choose the number of packs of playing cards (standard 52-card decks) to use.
   - Combine the selected packs into a single deck.
   - Shuffle the deck.

2. **Playing the Game:**
   - Cards are drawn sequentially from the top of the deck into a pile.
   - If two cards match based on the chosen condition (suits, values, or both), the first player to declare "Match!" takes all the cards in the pile.
   - Play continues with the next card in the deck, starting a new pile.
   - The game ends when no more cards can be drawn from the deck, and no player can declare "Match!" (any remaining cards in the pile are discarded).

3. **Match Conditions:**
   - **Suits:** Two cards match if their suits are the same (e.g., "3 of hearts" and "5 of hearts").
   - **Values:** Two cards match if their values are identical (e.g., "7 of hearts" and "7 of clubs").
   - **Both Suit and Value:** Only cards with both matching suit and value (e.g., "Jack of spades" matching another "Jack of spades") count as a match.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.
   - The game may end in a draw if both players have an equal number of cards.
